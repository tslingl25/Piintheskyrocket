# Pi in the sky project
By Nathaniel and Thomas

**Project Goal: Launch a Raspberry Pi into the air and have it record data then land safely**

## Project Planning

### Project Outline
  To make a mortar that launches water rockects out of it by throwing one in and it getting punctured through the cap by a nail at the bottom of the mortar to then launch the rocket.
  
### Materials
  + Cvc Pipe
  + Sharp Nail
  + 2L Soda Bottle
  + Nose Cone(3d Printed)
  + Fins(3d Printed)
  + Parachute
  + Casing for Electronice(3d Printed/Lasercut)
  + Electronics
    + Raspberry Pi
    + Altimeter
    + Battery 
    + Circuit Board
    
### Function
  The mechanism for how the mortar is very simple. You throw a pressurized water rocket into the mortar and when it hits the bottom, there is a nail that punctures the cap of the water rocket, releasing the pressure and propelling the rocket upwards. The mortar itself will be a simple cvc pipe that is set at an angle on a stand to send the water rocket in an ark, like a mortar.
  
### What we need to learn
  We need to figure out the ideal size of the cvc pipe to optimize the launch, as well as figure how to design the rocket itself. Specifically we need to design an area to safely hold the raspberry pi and whether we would need a parachute or not. Also, we need to figure out how water pressure works and what the best way to optimize it is for our purposes.
  
### What is success?
  Have a functionioning Mortar that can effectively launch multiple water rockets at a time without flaw and having one of the rockets measure the height it reaches and possibly measure it's arc and the distance it travels as well. Also, try to make the rockets go as high and as far as we can.
  
### Saftey concerns/Risk Mitigation
  The risks of the water rocket is the highly pressurized water that could hurt someone or certainly get someone wet. To mitigate these risks we will make sure everone is using proper PPE and make sure everyone is far enough away at launch. Another risk is the nail in the bottom of the mortar which will be very sharp, we will mitigate this risk by handiling the nail safely and as little as possible. The only other risk is the flight path of the rocket, we will mitigate this risk by making sure everyone is out of the way in the way the mortar is pointing as to not hit anyone.
  
### Iterations 

+ #### Debates about the protection of the components
   + No parachute or substantial protection. Cons: All components would break constant replacement and Mr. Miller angry. Pros: Very light and Easy
   + Substantial protection through securing electronics to wall of the cone. Cons: Components would probably still break, Mr Miller probably angry. Pros: Very light, might provide some protection
   + Peanut Butter protection. Cons: Messy, Ruins the electornics, 3d printed stuff would still break. Pros: Peanut Butter, Electronics wouldn't break?
   + **Parachute. Cons: Heavier, hard to design, might not work. Pros: Should protect electronics and all components.**
+ #### Launching Mechanism
   + Rocket launcher. Cons: Lame, boring, unoriginal. Pros: It would go very high, Very easy to make/use, safe.
   + **Mortar. Cons: Rocket can't get as high, slightly unsafe. Pros: Awesome, goes in a measurable? arc, can launch multiple rockets/shells**
   + Truck Rockets. Cons: Nothing at all, "unsafe". Pros: Awesome, moveable, on a golf cart.

#ONSHAPE

Base-
To make the base we stole Wills picture of a bottle and traced it with a spline. We then revolved it and cut weight reduceing gaps in the base. We also cut the base in half so thatis can be bolted together with a flange.



Threads-
The threads at the top of the base were homemade from scratch. We drew a helix and then revolved a triangle around the helix. The other piece was then boleaned from the new threads to make the finished product. The result was buttery smooth threads with no thread tool needed. Nice!
